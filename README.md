# WC-BSMs

'models.nb' file demonstrates the implementation of 16 BSMs in CoDEx. In addition to the tree-level Wilson coefficients, the matching results include contributions from both pure heavy and heavy-light mixed 1-loop processes.


The 'CoDEx.m' file here is a developer version, and will be made public soon.
